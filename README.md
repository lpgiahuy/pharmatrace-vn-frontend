## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18.x or higher)
- npm or yarn or pnpm

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd pharmatrace-vn-frontend
   ```

2. **Install all dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment:**
   Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   *(By default, Mock mode is ON; you do not need the backend running to preview the UI)*

4. **Start the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   🚀 Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the port Vite provides) in your browser.

---

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Adjust the `.env` file based on your environment:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api   # Point to your Node.js Backend
VITE_APP_NAME="PharmaTrace VN"                   # App Name displayed in UI/Title
VITE_USE_MOCK=true                            # Set to 'false' to connect to real Backend
VITE_REFRESH_TOKEN_THRESHOLD=300000           # Auto-refresh JWT 5 mins before expiration
```

---

## 🔑 Demo Credentials

Use the following test accounts to explore different portals when logging in:

| Role      | Portal Access | Email                        | Password     |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------------|--------------|
| **Admin** | ERP & WMS     | `admin@pharmatrace.vn`       | `password123`|
| **Staff** | WMS Only      | `warehouse@pharmatrace.vn`   | `password123`|
| **User**  | E-Commerce    | `customer@test.com`          | `password123`|

---

## 🔌 Connecting to Backend

To integrate with the real `pharmatrace_vn_backend` API:

1. Update your `.env` file:
   ```env
   VITE_USE_MOCK=false
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   ```
2. The Axios client (`src/services/apiClient.js`) is pre-configured to automatically attach `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to outbound requests.
3. On a `401 Unauthorized` response, the interceptor will automatically attempt to refresh the session seamlessly.

---

## 📜 Available Scripts

- **`npm run build`**: Compiles and minifies the application for production into the `dist/` directory.
- **`npm run preview`**: Boots up a local static web server to preview the production `dist/` build.
- **`npm run lint`**: Runs ESLint to find and optionally fix problems in JavaScript/React code.
